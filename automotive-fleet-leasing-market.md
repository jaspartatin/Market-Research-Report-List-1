<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Fleet Leasing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Ended</li><li>Close Ended</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive fleet leasing can be categorized into two primary types: open-ended and closed-ended leases. In an open-ended lease, the lessee is responsible for the vehicle's residual value at the end of the lease term, often leading to potentially higher costs if the vehicle’s market value drops. Conversely, a closed-ended lease establishes a predetermined residual value, assuring the lessee that they will not owe more than this amount at lease end, making it a more predictable financial option.</p></p>
